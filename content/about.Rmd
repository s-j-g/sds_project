# About Me

Hello, my name is Sally Jung! I'm pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Science with a focus in biology and a B.A. in Geography at the University of Texas at Austin. My interests are in ecology, ecological restoration, conservation, and water resources. I'm currently a project leader for UT Microfarm and last summer I worked as an undergraduate research intern through the NSF REU program at the Jornada LTER site. In my free time I love to garden, bake, canoe, and eat icecream (especially Tillamook)!
